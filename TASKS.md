# Tasks

Scratchpad. Debt goes here as it is created, not afterwards.

Known rough edges, not fixed here:
- A failed Lessons search (`on_search`) answers with an empty `Ranked` rather than
  surfacing the error — `Frame::Ranked` has no error field to put one in.

## Known debt

- **A Worker cannot report failure as failure.** A Result is written from the review's
  `<summary>`, which always records success. Only the Harness writes a failure, and
  only when the model cannot be reached. A Worker or review that decides a Task is
  impossible submits that statement as a successful Result saying so.

- **A Comms Session's context grows without bound.** It is standing, one per Channel,
  and keeps context across every message — it never dies, so nothing trims it. Worker
  Sessions avoid this by being ephemeral. Now that Sessions persist, the context also
  outlives the process it was built in, so this bites sooner than it used to.

- **Nothing prunes the database.** Every Session, message and model call is kept
  forever. That is what makes the `memory` Role work across runs, and it means the
  file grows without bound. No answer needed yet; the shape when it bites is probably
  to keep Tasks and Lessons and drop the conversations behind old finished Sessions.

- **Embedding calls are invisible to Spend.** `memory.rs` talks to the embedding
  service directly, not through the scheduler, so an embedding is not a Model call and
  what it costs never reaches the run total or the UI. It is small — a batch of a few
  dozen short texts is a fraction of a cent — but the number shown is knowingly
  incomplete rather than exact, which is a worse property than the size suggests.

- Use sqlite vec instead of manual cosine
- Memory search results cutoff by similarity
- Sessions are cutoff when calling view_session
